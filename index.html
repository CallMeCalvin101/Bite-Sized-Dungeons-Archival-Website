						<h2>Bite Sized Dungeons</h2>
						<ul> Project Requirements/Constraints
							<li>Online Multiplayer: game must have some sort of server component</li>
							<li>Localization: game must support two different languages </li>
							<li>Limited DexterityMust be played by only using 1 hand</li>
							<li>Limited Energy & Attention: Natural 'resting' point of two minutes of active play</li>
							<li>Limited Audition: Game must be completed by a player who cannot hear nay sounds from the game</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Bite Sized Dungeons is a real-time online multipayer dungeon crawler and our project for CMPM 171: Game Design Studio.</p>
						<p>The development for this project was split into three sprints consisting of three weeks each.
							The frontend for our game was developed using <em>Phaser 3</em> and written in <em>TypeScript</em>. Our server uses <em>Node.js</em> and <em>Socket.io</em> for real-time client-server communication.
			
						</p>
						<p>Below is a brief summary of what each group member did throughout the pre-production of the game</p>
						<ul> 
							<li>Vincent: Created core gameplay loop of the game, designed the classes, abilities, and enemies shown in the verticle slice, working on bringing the client and server to life</li>
							<li>Sooin: Helped prototype out different libraries to facilitate the multiplayer of our game, currently looking into </li>
							<li>Louis: Implemented the visuals and sounds of the game, including the background music, sound effects, and dragon icon of our game</li>
							<li>Christian: Tested a working client and server prototype, implemented the splash screens, and currently working the client and server of our game</li>
							<li>Alex: Helped define and implement our plans for the server and how to implement our game with a client-server model</li>
						</ul>

								<h3>Sprint 1: Research</h3>
								<p>During this sprint, we reasearched how we were going to build our game. This included looking into various tools that we should use during development. </p>
								<p> 8 low fidelity prototypes were created during this sprint, 2 by each team member.</p>
								<p>An example of a prototype includes simple client-server communication</p>
								<p></p>

								<h3>Sprint 2: Development</h3>
								<p>For this sprint we produced 8 high fidelity prototypes that we could build off of for the verical slice.</p>
								<p>The focus for this was to create a compelling core gameplay loop as well as connecting our game server to our Phaser client.</p>
								<p>During this phase, we incorporated GitHub Actions for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) into our project.</p>

								<h3>Sprint 3: Vertical Slice</h3>
								<p>The final stretch of our project consisted of using everything we learned from sprints 1 & 2 and creating a vertical slice. You can view a video demoing our game here.</p>

								<p>For our vertical slice sprint, we created a single player experience of our game. Unfortunately, we were not able to figure out the server 
									with the method we were implementing. We did however learn alot about creating and organizing server code. Our implementation includes a Room Manager class
									that manages the Game State Manager, which manages the Game State. Ultimately, we did learn a lot. For CMPM 172, we intend to implement the server using a different method such
									as using a Multiplayer framework that syncs the game state between clients, like Colyseus.
